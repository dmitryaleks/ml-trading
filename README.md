## Time Series Models

A time series is often modelled as a stochastic process consisting of a collection of random variables with one variable for each point in time.

Univariate time series: consist of a single value.
Multivariate time series: consist of several observations that can be represented by a vector.

### Time Series Decomposition

Components:
  - (systematic) trend;
  - (systematic) seasonality and cycles;
  - (unsystematic) noise.

```python
components = tsa.seasonal_decompose(data, model='additive')

ts = (data.to_frame('Original')
      .assign(Trend=components.trend)
      .assign(Seasonality=components.seasonal)
      .assign(Residual=components.resid))
```
